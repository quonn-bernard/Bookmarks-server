//Problems & Fixes

//Problem #1
//Server was returning collection object with 3 keys but I was only able to access 2 of those keys in the client

//Solution #1
//Object was being serialized before being returned to the client and the serialized function was only returning 2 keys, so I added the missing keys
//and am now able to see all 3 keys in the client
